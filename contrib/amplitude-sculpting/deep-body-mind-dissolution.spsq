## Deep Body Mind Dissolution
## Created by @jlundi on 2025-07-30
## 
## This session is built to progressively deepen the user's state by preserving hypnagogic awareness while
## leading the body into a delta-dominant healing state. It uses all five key brainwave bands—delta (1.5 Hz),
## theta (4.5 Hz), alpha (8.5 Hz), beta/SMR (15 Hz), and gamma (40 Hz)—but dynamically adjusts their amplitude
## over time rather than changing frequencies. This models how brain states shift naturally during sleep onset,
## trauma release, or meditative descent.
##
## 🧠 Phase-by-Phase Breakdown:
##
## Phase 1 (0:00–15:00) – Stabilization & Entry
##
## Goal: Transition from waking awareness into hypnagogia.
##
## Design:
##
## Balanced presence of all bands to represent full-spectrum cognitive engagement.
##
## Alpha (8.5 Hz) is highest, grounding the user in closed-eye stillness.
##
## SMR (15 Hz) and gamma (40 Hz) gently stimulate focus and body awareness without agitation.
##
## Low delta/theta (1.5 & 4.5 Hz) begin the descent.
##
## ✅ Ideal for establishing the “mind awake, body relaxing” state.
##
## Phase 2 (15:00–30:00) – Descending into Deep Theta/Delta
##
## Goal: Dissolve surface cognition, increase somatic access.
##
## Design:
##
## Strong increase in delta (1.5 Hz) and theta (4.5 Hz) amplitude.
##
## Sharp drop in alpha, SMR, and gamma, helping the cognitive self recede.
##
## This shift mimics the moment when the thinking mind fades and floating awareness begins.
##
## 🛑 Here the user may enter dreamlike states, emotional processing, or body release.
##
## Phase 3 (30:00–45:00) – Delta Dominance / Deep Work
##
## Goal: Full immersion in a delta/theta healing field.
##
## Design:
##
## Delta (1.5 Hz) and especially theta (4.5 Hz) dominate.
##
## All other bands suppressed to bare minimums.
##
## This is a liminal state, often linked to trauma integration, lucid processing, or deep sleep access
## while awareness remains online.
##
## 💡 Useful for deep inner work, subconscious contact, or preparation for lucid/OBE state.
##
## Phase 4 (45:00–47:00) – Stabilized Holding
##
## Goal: Brief extension of deep-state coherence.
##
## Design:
##
## Same as Phase 3 to reinforce entrainment.
##
## Acts as a soft landing, consolidating the delta/theta field.
##
## 🧘 Prevents sudden return to waking-state frequencies, allowing gentle exit.
##
## 📌 Summary
##
## This session is built around volume shaping, not frequency shifting. By keeping all five bands present
## but modulating their amplitude, it respects how real human brainwaves work—not in isolation, but in
## layered dynamics. The entire curve supports:
##
## Safe descent into healing delta/theta
##
## Maintenance of subtle awareness
##
## Minimal overstimulation

## Gradual return via silence
