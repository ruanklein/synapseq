# SynapSeq

**Synapse-Sequenced Brainwave Generator**

SynapSeq is a lightweight and efficient engine for sequencing audio tones for brainwave entrainment, using a simple text-based format. It helps induce states such as relaxation, meditation, and focused awareness by guiding brainwave frequencies through sound.

## Quick Start Example

Save the following content as `relax.spsq`:

```
# Presets
alpha
  noise brown amplitude 40
  tone 250 binaural 10.0 amplitude 10
theta
  noise brown amplitude 40
  tone 250 binaural 5.0 amplitude 10

# Timeline sequence
00:00:00 silence
00:00:15 alpha
00:02:00 alpha
00:03:00 theta
00:04:00 theta
00:05:00 alpha
00:06:00 alpha
00:07:00 theta
00:08:00 theta
00:09:00 alpha
00:10:00 silence
```

Run SynapSeq to generate the audio file:

```bash
synapseq --output relax.wav relax.spsq    # Save the audio file
synapseq --output - relax.spsq | play -   # Or play directly (UNIX only)
```

The audio file will be created in the current directory.

### Phase Sequence

When processing this file, SynapSeq will execute the following sequence of phases:

```
Phases:
├─ 0:00-0:15: Fade-in from silence to alpha (start of sequence)
├─ 0:15-2:00: alpha (10Hz) - Brown noise + binaural tone
├─ 2:00-3:00: Transition: 10Hz → 5Hz (alpha → theta)
├─ 3:00-4:00: theta (5Hz) - Brown noise + binaural tone
├─ 4:00-5:00: Transition: 5Hz → 10Hz (theta → alpha)
├─ 5:00-6:00: alpha (10Hz)
├─ 6:00-7:00: Transition: 10Hz → 5Hz (alpha → theta)
├─ 7:00-8:00: theta (5Hz)
├─ 8:00-9:00: Transition: 5Hz → 10Hz (theta → alpha)
└─ 9:00-10:00: Fade-out from alpha to silence (end of sequence)
```

### More Examples

You can find additional example scripts in the `samples/` folder of this repository. These include various types of brainwave entrainment sequences that you can download and test:

- `sample-binaural.spsq` - Binaural beats example
- `sample-isochronic.spsq` - Isochronic tones example
- `sample-monaural.spsq` - Monaural beats example
- `sample-noise.spsq` - Noise-based entrainment
- `sample-spin.spsq` - Spinning frequency effects
- `sample-waveform.spsq` - Custom waveform example

## Installation

SynapSeq is a command-line tool, not a traditional desktop application. You can use it in two ways:

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to use SynapSeq is with Docker, without needing to compile or install anything on your system.

```bash
docker run --rm -v ./spsq:/data ruanklein/synapseq --output Relax.wav Relax.spsq
```

In this command:

- `--rm` removes the container after execution
- `-v ./spsq:/data` maps your local folder containing `.spsq` files to the container's `/data` directory
- The SynapSeq command follows the same syntax as the compiled version

Make sure your `.spsq` files are in the local folder you're mapping to `/data`.

### Option 2: Compile from Source

Alternatively, you can compile SynapSeq from source and use it directly from the terminal as part of your audio workflow.

## Compilation

SynapSeq can be compiled for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### macOS

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools on your system:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Install either [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) if you don't have any of them yet.

If using Homebrew, install the required dependencies with:

```bash
brew install pkg-config libvorbis libmad
```

If using MacPorts, install the required dependencies with:

```bash
port install pkgconfig libvorbis libmad
```

Run the build script to create the binary:

```bash
./build/macos-build-synapseq.sh
```

The binary will be created in the `build/dist` folder.

To install the binary system-wide:

```bash
sudo cp build/dist/synapseq-macos-arm64 /usr/local/bin/synapseq
```

### Linux

On Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions, install the dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libmad0-dev
```

Run the build script to create the binary:

```bash
./build/linux-build-synapseq.sh # Build a dynamic binary (recommended)
./build/linux-build-synapseq-static.sh # Or build a static binary (optional)
```

The binary will be created in the `build/dist` folder.

To install the binary system-wide:

```bash
sudo cp build/dist/synapseq-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/synapseq # For x86_64
sudo cp build/dist/synapseq-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/synapseq # For arm64
```

### Windows

On Windows, the recommended way to build SynapSeq is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with WSL2.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Run this sequence of commands to build SynapSeq (x86-64 only):

```bash
docker compose -f build/compose.yml up build-windows-libs-x86-64
docker compose -f build/compose.yml up build-windows-synapseq-x86-64
```

The `.exe` file will be created in the `build/dist` folder.

#### Installing the executable

To install SynapSeq system-wide on Windows:

1. **Copy the executable to a permanent location (run Command Prompt as Administrator):**

   ```cmd
   mkdir "C:\Program Files\SynapSeq"
   copy "build\dist\synapseq-windows-x86_64.exe" "C:\Program Files\SynapSeq\synapseq.exe"
   ```

2. **Add to PATH environment variable:**

   - Open "Environment Variables" (search for it in Start menu)
   - In "System Variables", find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
   - Click "New" and add: `C:\Program Files\SynapSeq`
   - Click "OK" to save all changes
   - Restart your terminal/command prompt

3. **Verify installation (in Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
   ```cmd
   synapseq --version
   ```

After installation, you can use `synapseq` from any directory in your terminal.
