## üí° About This Project

SynapSeq (formerly called SBaGen+) is a modern, open-source brainwave generator built to produce and sequence audio tones for brainwave entrainment. It supports both binaural beats and isochronic tones, allowing users to design precise audio sessions targeting relaxation, focus, meditation, and cognitive stimulation.

Originally based on the SBaGen, SynapSeq has evolved beyond its origins. With active development focused on usability, clarity, and compatibility with modern systems.

SynapSeq aims to be a reliable and scriptable tool for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to generate customizable neural stimulation sessions through sound.

## üì• Installation

You can download pre-built binaries on Linux and installers for Windows and macOS from the [releases page](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases).

### üê≥ Using SynapSeq with Docker

If you don‚Äôt want to install SynapSeq on your machine, there‚Äôs the option to use it via Docker.

SynapSeq for Docker was compiled without support for directly playing .spsq files. Therefore, the way to use SynapSeq via Docker is by generating output files in RAW or WAV format.

The default image uses scratch to offer a simplified usage for most cases. Use this image if you just want to generate WAV files from your .spsq files using SynapSeq, without having to install synapseq on your machine.

To use .spsq files, you need to map the **/spsq** folder to your local spsq files directory, for example:

```
docker run --rm -v ./spsq:/spsq ruanklein/synapseq -m river1.ogg -Wo out.wav Sleep.spsq
```

This will generate a WAV file in your sbg directory.

If you want to use media files (ogg/mp3/wav) with the -m parameter, make sure they are in the same folder as your .spsq file.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Pre-built Binaries

The latest release (v2.0.0) can be downloaded directly from the following links:

- Linux 32-bit: [synapseq-linux32](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-linux32)
- Linux 64-bit: [synapseq-linux64](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-linux64)
- macOS Installer: [SynapSeq Installer.dmg](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/SynapSeq-Installer.dmg)
- Windows x86/x86_64 and ARM64: [synapseq-windows-setup.exe](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-windows-setup.exe)

  **Important**: Always verify the SHA256 checksum of downloaded binaries against those listed on the [releases page](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases) to ensure file integrity and security.

### üêß Installing on Linux

1. Download the appropriate binary for your system:

   ```bash
   # For 64-bit systems
   wget https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-linux64

   # For 32-bit systems
   wget https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-linux32

   # For ARM64 systems
   wget https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-linux-arm64
   ```

2. Verify the SHA256 checksum:

   ```bash
   sha256sum synapseq-linux64  # Replace with your downloaded file
   # Compare the output with the checksum on the releases page
   ```

3. Make the binary executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x synapseq-linux64  # Replace with your downloaded file
   ```

4. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv synapseq-linux64 /usr/local/bin/synapseq  # Replace with your downloaded file
   ```

5. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   synapseq -h
   ```

### üçé Installing on macOS

1. Download the macOS Installer: [SynapSeq Installer.dmg](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/SynapSeq-Installer.dmg)

2. Verify the SHA256 checksum. You can use the `shasum` command on the terminal to verify the checksum:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   shasum -a 256 SynapSeq-Installer.dmg
   # Compare the output with the checksum on the releases page
   ```

3. Open the DMG file and drag the `SynapSeq` application to the Applications folder.

4. Run the `SynapSeq` application from the Applications folder, accept the license agreement and click the `View Examples` button to view examples of spsq files.

5. Click in the .spsq file to play, edit or convert it. Also, you can drop spsq files on the `SynapSeq` application icon to open them.

**Important:** The `SynapSeq` application is not digitally signed, so you may need to add an exception on the `System Settings -> Security & Privacy -> General tab`.

If you want to use SynapSeq as a command-line tool, you can create a symlink to the `synapseq` binary in your PATH.

```bash
sudo ln -s /Applications/SynapSeq.app/Contents/Resources/bin/synapseq /usr/local/bin/synapseq
```

And you can see the usage with:

```bash
synapseq -h
```

### ü™ü Installing on Windows

1. Download the installer:

   - [synapseq-windows-setup.exe](https://github.com/ruanklein/synapseq/releases/download/v2.0.0/synapseq-windows-setup.exe)

2. Verify the SHA256 checksum of the installer. You can use PowerShell or Command Prompt to do this:

   ```powershell
   Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\synapseq-windows-setup.exe
   # Compare the output with the checksum on the releases page
   ```

3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning about antivirus on Windows**

Some versions of Windows Defender or other antivirus software may falsely detect `SynapSeq` as a threat.

This happens because the executable is **not digitally signed**, and as a command-line program, it may be flagged as suspicious by default.

`SynapSeq` is an open-source project, and the source code is publicly available in this repository for inspection.

‚úÖ **Temporary solution:** if you trust the source of the executable, add an exception in your antivirus for the file or the folder where `SynapSeq` is installed.

## üöÄ Basic Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for more information on how to use SynapSeq.

## üìö Documentation

For detailed information on all features, see the [SYNAPSEQ.txt](docs/SYNAPSEQ.txt) file.

## üîç Research

For the scientific background behind SynapSeq, check out [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

SynapSeq can be compiled for macOS, Linux and Windows. The build process is divided into two steps:

1. **Building the libraries**: This step is only necessary if you want MP3 and OGG support
2. **Building the main program**: This step compiles SynapSeq using the libraries built in the previous step

### üìÅ Build Scripts Structure

- **Library build scripts**:

  - `macos-build-libs.sh`: Builds libraries for macOS (universal binary - ARM64 + x86_64)
  - `linux-build-libs.sh`: Builds libraries for Linux (32-bit, 64-bit, ARM64 [if native])
  - `windows-build-libs.sh`: Builds libraries for Windows using MinGW (cross-compilation)

- **Main program build scripts**:
  - `macos-build-synapseq.sh`: Builds SynapSeq for macOS (universal binary - ARM64 + x86_64)
  - `linux-build-synapseq.sh`: Builds SynapSeq for Linux (32-bit, 64-bit, ARM64 [if native])
  - `windows-build-synapseq.sh`: Builds SynapSeq for Windows using MinGW (cross-compilation)

#### üê≥ Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Simplest Method)

The easiest way to build SynapSeq for Linux and Windows is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build all Linux and Windows binaries with a single command
docker compose up build

# Build for Linux ARM64
docker compose up build-arm64
```

This will automatically build the Docker image and run all necessary build scripts to generate the binaries for Linux and Windows. All compiled binaries will be placed in the `dist` directory.

**For macOS**, you need compile natively. See next section for more details.

#### üíª Option 2: Building Natively

If you prefer to build without Docker, you can use the build scripts directly on your system, provided you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

You can see the dependencies in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). For macOS, you need the Xcode command line tools installed and home brew installed..

The build scripts are:

```
<platform>-build-libs.sh # macOS, Linux, Windows
<platform>-build-synapseq.sh # macOS, Linux, Windows
<platform>-create-installer.sh # macOS, Windows
```

Run the script with the `platform` you use. This will create a installers and binaries in the `dist` directory.
