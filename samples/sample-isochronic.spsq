## ISOCHRONIC TONES DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates isochronic tone technology for brainwave entrainment
## using alpha frequencies (8-11Hz) with a 250Hz carrier tone.
##
## HOW ISOCHRONIC TONES WORK:
## Isochronic tones are single tones that turn on and off at regular intervals,
## creating distinct pulses of sound. Unlike beats, these are actual interruptions
## in the audio signal that create a rhythmic pulsing pattern.
##
## TECHNICAL PROCESS:
## - Single 250Hz tone is turned on and off at the target frequency
## - Example: For 8Hz entrainment, the tone pulses 8 times per second
## - Creates clear, distinct audio pulses with silence between them
## - Both ears receive identical pulsing pattern
## - No phase relationships or frequency mixing required
##
## COMPARISON OF ENTRAINMENT METHODS:
## BINAURAL BEATS:
## - Two different frequencies in each ear (phantom beat in brain)
## - Requires headphones for proper separation
## - Subtle effect, brain creates the beating sensation
##
## MONAURAL BEATS:
## - Two frequencies mixed together before reaching ears
## - Audible beating pattern, works with speakers
## - Physical sound phenomenon both ears hear
##
## ISOCHRONIC TONES:
## - Single tone pulsing on/off at target frequency
## - Most direct and pronounced entrainment method
## - Clear, distinct pulses that are impossible to ignore
## - Works excellently with speakers or headphones
## - Often considered the most effective entrainment method
##
## ALPHA BRAINWAVE RANGE (8-14Hz):
## - 8Hz: Deep relaxation, light meditation, creativity enhancement
## - 9Hz: Enhanced focus, calm awareness, stress reduction
## - 10Hz: Classic alpha state, relaxed alertness, improved learning
## - 11Hz: Increased mental clarity, bridge to beta frequencies
##
## PINK NOISE BACKGROUND:
## Pink noise provides a natural masking sound that softens the sharp edges
## of the isochronic pulses while maintaining their effectiveness. The amplitude
## gradually decreases to emphasize the pulsing tones.
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Initial silence
## 00:15-02:30: 8Hz ISOCHRONIC - deep relaxation with clear 8 pulses per second
## 02:30-04:00: 9Hz ISOCHRONIC - transitioning to enhanced focus (9 pulses/sec)
## 04:00-05:30: 10Hz ISOCHRONIC - classic alpha state (10 pulses/sec)
## 05:30-07:00: 11Hz ISOCHRONIC - mental clarity (11 pulses/sec)
## 07:00+: End of sequence
##
## USAGE TIPS:
## - Most effective entrainment method due to clear, distinct pulses
## - You will clearly hear the rhythmic pulsing pattern
## - Works excellently with speakers - no headphones required
## - May be too stimulating for some users compared to binaural/monaural
## - Ideal for active meditation, study sessions, or when you need clear focus
## - Progressive alpha sequence perfect for cognitive enhancement
