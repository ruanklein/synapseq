## MONAURAL BEATS DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates monaural beat technology for brainwave entrainment
## using alpha frequencies (8-11Hz) with a 250Hz carrier tone.
##
## HOW MONAURAL BEATS WORK:
## Monaural beats are created by mixing two slightly different frequencies together
## before they reach your ears. Unlike binaural beats, you can actually hear the
## beating pattern as a physical sound phenomenon.
##
## TECHNICAL PROCESS:
## - Two frequencies are mixed: 250Hz + (250Hz + beat frequency)
## - Example: 250Hz + 258Hz = audible 8Hz beating pattern
## - Both ears receive the same mixed signal with the beating pattern
## - The physical beating stimulates brainwave entrainment more directly
## - No headphones required (though recommended for better experience)
##
## MONAURAL VS BINAURAL DIFFERENCES:
## - Monaural: Actual beating sound that both ears hear
## - Binaural: Phantom beat created by the brain from two separate frequencies
## - Monaural: Often considered more effective for entrainment
## - Monaural: Works with speakers, not just headphones
##
## ALPHA BRAINWAVE RANGE (8-14Hz):
## - 8Hz: Deep relaxation, light meditation, creativity enhancement
## - 9Hz: Enhanced focus, calm awareness, stress reduction
## - 10Hz: Classic alpha state, relaxed alertness, improved learning
## - 11Hz: Increased mental clarity, bridge to beta frequencies
##
## PINK NOISE BACKGROUND:
## Pink noise provides a natural masking sound that enhances the monaural effect
## and creates a more pleasant listening experience. The amplitude gradually
## decreases throughout the session to emphasize the monaural tones.
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Initial silence
## 00:15-02:30: 8Hz MONAURAL - deep relaxation and creative state induction
## 02:30-04:00: 9Hz MONAURAL - transitioning to enhanced focus and calm awareness
## 04:00-05:30: 10Hz MONAURAL - classic alpha state for optimal learning and relaxation
## 05:30-07:00: 11Hz MONAURAL - mental clarity and preparation for higher states
## 07:00+: End of sequence
##
## USAGE TIPS:
## - Can be used with speakers or headphones (headphones still recommended)
## - You will hear the actual beating rhythm as a pulsing sound
## - Find a quiet environment to best perceive the beating patterns
## - Progressive alpha sequence ideal for study sessions, meditation, or creative work
## - More direct entrainment effect compared to binaural beats
