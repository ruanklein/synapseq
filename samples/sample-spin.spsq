## SPIN EFFECT DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates the spatial rotation effect using different noise types
## 
## HOW SPIN WORKS:
## The "spin" effect creates a sensation of circular sound movement between your ears
## using different types of noise as the base audio source.
##
## SPIN PARAMETERS:
## - width: rotation width (300Hz = smooth and wide rotation)
## - rate: rotation speed (1.5Hz = 1.5 rotations per second) 
## - amplitude: amplitude of the noise (15% amplitude)
##
## The spin effect works by modulating the amplitude of noise between left and right channels,
## creating a sensation of circular movement. The sound "rotates" around your head.
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Initial silence
## 00:15-00:30: BROWN NOISE SPINNING - warmer, deeper sound with more low-frequency energy
## 00:30-00:45: PINK NOISE SPINNING - balanced, natural sound with equal energy per octave  
## 00:45-01:00: WHITE NOISE SPINNING - brighter, sharper sound with equal energy at all frequencies
## 01:00+: End of sequence
##
## USAGE TIP:
## Use headphones to best experience the spatial rotation effect.
## The spin effect is ideal for relaxation and can help with focus and concentration.
