## BINAURAL BEATS DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates binaural beat technology for brainwave entrainment
## using alpha frequencies (8-11Hz) with a 250Hz carrier tone.
##
## HOW BINAURAL BEATS WORK:
## Binaural beats occur when two slightly different frequencies are played separately
## in each ear. The brain perceives a third "phantom" beat at the difference frequency.
##
## TECHNICAL PROCESS:
## - Left ear: 250Hz carrier frequency
## - Right ear: 250Hz + binaural frequency (e.g., 250Hz + 8Hz = 258Hz)
## - Brain perceives: 8Hz beating pattern (the difference between the two frequencies)
## - This 8Hz pattern can influence brainwave activity and mental states
##
## ALPHA BRAINWAVE RANGE (8-14Hz):
## - 8Hz: Deep relaxation, light meditation, creativity enhancement
## - 9Hz: Enhanced focus, calm awareness, stress reduction  
## - 10Hz: Classic alpha state, relaxed alertness, improved learning
## - 11Hz: Increased mental clarity, bridge to beta frequencies
##
## PINK NOISE BACKGROUND:
## Pink noise provides a natural masking sound that enhances the binaural effect
## and creates a more pleasant listening experience. The amplitude gradually 
## decreases throughout the session to emphasize the binaural tones.
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Initial silence
## 00:15-02:30: 8Hz BINAURAL - deep relaxation and creative state induction
## 02:30-04:00: 9Hz BINAURAL - transitioning to enhanced focus and calm awareness
## 04:00-05:30: 10Hz BINAURAL - classic alpha state for optimal learning and relaxation
## 05:30-07:00: 11Hz BINAURAL - mental clarity and preparation for higher states
## 07:00+: End of sequence
##
## USAGE TIPS:
## - Use stereo headphones for optimal binaural beat perception
## - Find a quiet environment to minimize distractions
## - This progressive alpha sequence is ideal for study sessions, meditation, or creative work
## - The gradual frequency increase helps maintain alertness while staying relaxed
