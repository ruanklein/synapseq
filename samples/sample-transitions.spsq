## TRANSITION CURVES
## 
## Transitions control how audio parameters transition between two states over time.
## The system calculates an interpolation factor α (alpha) from 0 to 1, then applies:
##   value = (1-α) * start + α * end
##
## What changes with a transition:
##   - Numerical parameters: amplitude, carrier frequency, resonance, intensity
##   - What doesn't crossfade: tone type (binaural/monaural/etc.) and waveform
##     These switch instantly according to the destination preset
##
## Four transitions types:
##
## 1. LINEAR (steady) - Constant rate of change (default)
##    α(x) = x
##    - Uniform progression throughout the transition
##    - Neutral, mechanical feel
##    - Use when you want predictable, steady changes
##
## 2. LOGARITHMIC (ease-out) - Fast start, gentle landing
##    α(x) = ln(1 + (e^k - 1) x) / k
##    Stable form: α(x) = log1p(expm1(k) * x) / k
##    - Most change happens early, then gradually slows down
##    - Like a car braking smoothly to a stop
##    - Ideal for fade-outs or transitions that need a gentle ending
##
## 3. EXPONENTIAL (ease-in) - Gentle start, fast finish
##    α(x) = (e^{k x} - 1) / (e^k - 1)
##    Stable form: α(x) = expm1(k x) / expm1(k)
##    - Starts slowly, then accelerates toward the end
##    - Like a car smoothly accelerating from a stop
##    - Ideal for fade-ins or transitions that need a gentle beginning
##
## 4. SIGMOID (smooth) - Smooth acceleration and deceleration
##    α(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-k(x - 0.5)))
##    - Starts slow, accelerates in the middle, then decelerates smoothly
##    - S-shaped curve with gentle start and end
##    - Most natural-feeling transition, mimics human movement
##    - Ideal for smooth, organic transitions between states
##
## Curvature parameter k:
##   - Default: k = 6.0
##   - Higher k = more pronounced curve (stronger difference between start/end)
##   - Lower k = gentler curve (approaches linear)
