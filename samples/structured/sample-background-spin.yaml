  - "SPIN EFFECT DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE"
  - "This sample demonstrates the spatial rotation effect using a pink noise background."
  - ""
  - "HOW SPIN WORKS:"
  - 'The "spin" effect creates a sensation of circular sound movement between your ears'
  - "using the background sound chosen by the user as the base audio source."
  - ""
  - "SPIN PARAMETERS:"
  - "- width: rotation width (e.g. 300Hz = smooth and wide rotation)"
  - "- rate: rotation speed (e.g. 1.5Hz = 1.5 rotations per second)"
  - "- amplitude: amplitude of the background sound (e.g. 15% amplitude)"
  - ""
  - "The spin effect works by modulating the amplitude of the background sound between left and right channels,"
  - 'creating a sensation of circular movement. The sound "rotates" around your head.'
  - ""
  - "TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:"
  - "00:00-00:15: Fade in from silence"
  - "00:15-02:00: Spin effect with wide rotation (400Hz width) and moderate speed (10 rate)."
  - "03:30-04:30: Spin effect with narrower rotation (200Hz width) and slower speed (5 rate)."
  - "05:30-07:00: From ramp back to wide rotation (400Hz width) and moderate speed (10 rate)."
  - "09:30-10:00: Fade out to silence"
  - "10:00+: End of sequence"
  - ""
  - "Binaural tone added to enhance the experience with spin effect."
  - ""
  - "USAGE TIP:"
  - "Use headphones to best experience the spatial rotation effect."
  - "The spin effect is ideal for relaxation and can help with focus and concentration."
  - ""
  - "For a more subtle effect, use lower Intensity values; higher values make the"
  - "spin sensation stronger. You can also experiment with different waveforms for"
  - "the background spin to make the effect more pronounced or more gentle, according"
  - "to your preference."
