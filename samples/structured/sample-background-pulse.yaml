  - "PULSE EFFECT DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE"
  - "This sample demonstrates the pulse effect using a pink noise background."
  - ""
  - "HOW PULSE WORKS:"
  - 'The "pulse" effect creates a rhythmic pulsing sensation by modulating the amplitude of the'
  - "background sound chosen by the user."
  - ""
  - "PULSE PARAMETERS:"
  - "- rate: pulse frequency (e.g. 10Hz = 10 pulses per second)"
  - "- intensity: depth of amplitude modulation (e.g. 50 = moderate pulsing)"
  - "- amplitude: amplitude of the background sound (e.g. 50% amplitude)"
  - ""
  - "The pulse effect works by modulating the amplitude of the background sound in a rhythmic pattern,"
  - 'creating a sensation of isochronic pulses. The sound "pulses" evenly, ideal for focus and relaxation.'
  - ""
  - "TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:"
  - "00:00-00:15: Fade in from silence"
  - "00:15-02:00: Pulse effect with moderate rate (10Hz) and intensity (50)."
  - "03:30-04:30: Pulse effect with slower rate (5Hz) and lower intensity (35)."
  - "05:30-07:00: From ramp back to moderate rate (10Hz) and intensity (50)."
  - "09:30-10:00: Fade out to silence"
  - "10:00+: End of sequence"
  - ""
  - "Monaural tone added to enhance the experience with pulse effect."
  - ""
  - "USAGE TIP:"
  - "Use headphones to best experience the pulse effect."
  - "The pulse effect is ideal for relaxation and can help with focus and concentration."
  - ""
  - "For a more subtle effect, use lower Intensity values; higher values make the"
  - "pulsating sensation stronger. You can also experiment with different waveforms for"
  - "the background pulse to make the effect more pronounced or more gentle, according"
  - "to your preference."
