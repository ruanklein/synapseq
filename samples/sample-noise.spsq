## NOISE TYPES DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates the three main types of noise used in audio processing
## and brainwave entrainment: brown, pink, and white noise.
##
## NOISE CHARACTERISTICS:
## Each noise type has different frequency distribution properties that create
## distinct auditory experiences and psychological effects.
##
## BROWN NOISE (Red Noise):
## - More energy in lower frequencies, drops off at 6dB per octave
## - Creates a warmer, deeper sound similar to distant thunder or heavy rainfall
## - Often preferred for sleep, relaxation, and masking low-frequency sounds
## - Can help with focus by reducing distracting environmental noises
##
## PINK NOISE:
## - Equal energy per octave, drops off at 3dB per octave
## - Creates a balanced, natural sound similar to steady rainfall or ocean waves
## - Found naturally in many biological systems and environmental sounds
## - Excellent for general relaxation, meditation, and improving sleep quality
##
## WHITE NOISE:
## - Equal energy at all frequencies across the audible spectrum
## - Creates a brighter, sharper sound similar to static or hissing
## - Effective for masking sudden sounds and improving concentration
## - Commonly used in offices and study environments
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Initial silence
## 00:15-00:30: BROWN NOISE - experience the warm, deep low-frequency richness
## 00:30-00:45: PINK NOISE - notice the balanced, natural sound quality
## 00:45-01:00: WHITE NOISE - observe the bright, crisp high-frequency content
## 01:00+: End of sequence
##
## USAGE TIP:
## This comparison sequence helps you identify which noise type works best for your
## specific needs: relaxation, focus, sleep, or sound masking.
