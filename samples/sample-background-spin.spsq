## SPIN EFFECT DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE
## This sample demonstrates the spatial rotation effect using a pink noise background.
## 
## HOW SPIN WORKS:
## The "spin" effect creates a sensation of circular sound movement between your ears
## using the background sound chosen by the user as the base audio source.
##
## SPIN PARAMETERS:
## - width: rotation width (e.g. 300Hz = smooth and wide rotation)
## - rate: rotation speed (e.g. 1.5Hz = 1.5 rotations per second)
## - amplitude: amplitude of the background sound (e.g. 15% amplitude)
##
## The spin effect works by modulating the amplitude of the background sound between left and right channels,
## creating a sensation of circular movement. The sound "rotates" around your head.
##
## TEMPORAL SEQUENCE BREAKDOWN:
## 00:00-00:15: Fade in from silence
## 00:15-02:00: Spin effect with wide rotation (400Hz width) and moderate speed (10 rate).
## 03:30-04:30: Spin effect with narrower rotation (200Hz width) and slower speed (5 rate).
## 05:30-07:00: From ramp back to wide rotation (400Hz width) and moderate speed (10 rate).
## 09:30-10:00: Fade out to silence
## 10:00+: End of sequence
##
## Binaural tone added to enhance the experience with spin effect.
##
## USAGE TIP:
## Use headphones to best experience the spatial rotation effect.
## The spin effect is ideal for relaxation and can help with focus and concentration.
##
## For a more subtle effect, use lower Intensity values; higher values make the
## spin sensation stronger. You can also experiment with different waveforms for
## the background spin to make the effect more pronounced or more gentle, according
## to your preference.
