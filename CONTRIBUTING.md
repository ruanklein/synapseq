- üõ†Ô∏è PRs for the C version (v2) ‚Üí branch: `development` (bug fixes, docs, build scripts only)
- üéµ Sequence files (`.spsq`) ‚Üí see [`contrib/README.md`](./contrib/README.md)

## Contribution Policy

### Version 3.x (Go Rewrite)

- The current focus for version 3.0 (branch: `development-v3`) is the faithful porting of the original C code to idiomatic Go.
- **Only PRs that port code from C to Go, following the requirements and conventions described in [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md), will be accepted at this stage.**
- New features will only be considered starting in version **3.1+**, after the port is complete.
- Please open your PRs against `development-v3`.

### Version 2.x (C Codebase)

- The current C version (`synapseq.c`) is in **maintenance mode**.
- We still welcome contributions that add value for users:
  - **Bug fixes**
  - **Documentation improvements**
  - **Build scripts or integration tweaks** to support more systems and tools
- All PRs for the C codebase must target the `development` branch.

## Contributing Sequence Files (`.spsq`)

If you‚Äôd like to contribute new or improved sequence files (`.spsq`), please see [`contrib/README.md`](./contrib/README.md).  
This process is separate from code contributions.

---

## Commit Convention

We use the **Conventional Commits** format.  
Examples:

- `feat: add new waveform option`
- `fix: correct parsing bug for noise sequences`
- `docs: update README with usage examples`
- `build: add Makefile for macOS`
- `chore: clean up unused code in parser`

Following this format keeps the commit history clear and enables automated changelog generation in the future.
