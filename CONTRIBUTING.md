# Contributing to SynapSeq

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **SynapSeq**!
This project grows stronger with community support, whether through code, docs, bug reports, build scripts, or new ideas.

## TL;DR (Quick Summary)

üöÄ The `main` branch contains the latest Go (V3) codebase.  
üîÄ All pull requests (PRs) should target the `development` branch.  
üéµ Sequence files (`.spsq`) ‚Üí see [`contrib/README.md`](./contrib/README.md)

üóÇÔ∏è The legacy C code (V2, inherited from SBaGen) is available in the `v2` branch. If you wish to view, modify, or fork the old version, use that branch.

## Contribution Policy

### Version 3.x (Go)

- The `main` branch contains the latest Go (V3) codebase.
- All new features, bug fixes, and improvements should be submitted as PRs to the `development` branch.
- Follow Go best practices and maintain clean, readable code.
- Ensure backward compatibility when possible.

### Version 2.x (C, legacy)

- The legacy C codebase (V2, inherited from SBaGen) is available in the `v2` branch.
- No new features will be accepted for V2. Only maintenance or forks should use this branch.

## Contributing Sequence Files (`.spsq`)

If you‚Äôd like to contribute new or improved sequence files (`.spsq`), please see [`contrib/README.md`](./contrib/README.md).  
This process is separate from code contributions.

## Commit Convention

We use the **Conventional Commits** format.  
Examples:

- `feat: add new waveform option`
- `fix: correct parsing bug for noise sequences`
- `docs: update README with usage examples`
- `build: add Makefile for macOS`
- `chore: clean up unused code in parser`

Following this format keeps the commit history clear and enables automated changelog generation in the future.
