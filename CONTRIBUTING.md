# Contributing to SynapSeq

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **SynapSeq**!
This project grows stronger with community support, whether through code, docs, bug reports, build scripts, or new ideas.

## TL;DR (Quick Summary)

üöÄ The `main` branch contains the latest Go (V3) codebase.  
üîÄ All pull requests (PRs) should target the `development` branch.  
üéµ Sequence files (`.spsq`) ‚Üí see [`contrib/README.md`](./contrib/README.md)

üóÇÔ∏è The legacy C code (V2, inherited from SBaGen) is available in the `v2` branch. If you wish to view, modify, or fork the old version, use that branch.

## Contribution Policy

### Version 3.x (Go)

- The `main` branch contains the latest Go (V3) codebase.
- All new features, bug fixes, and improvements should be submitted as PRs to the `development` branch.
- Follow Go best practices and maintain clean, readable code.
- Ensure backward compatibility when possible.

#### Git Flow Workflow

SynapSeq V3 follows the **Git Flow** branching model:

**Main Branches:**

- `main` - Production-ready code, stable releases only
- `development` - Integration branch for features, next release preparation

**Supporting Branches:**

- `feature/*` - New features (branched from `development`)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes (branched from `development`)
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes for production (branched from `main`)
- `release/*` - Release preparation (branched from `development`)

**Workflow:**

1. **For new features:**

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add my new feature"
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   # Open PR to development branch
   ```

2. **For bug fixes:**

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b bugfix/fix-issue-description
   # Fix the bug
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: correct issue description"
   git push origin bugfix/fix-issue-description
   # Open PR to development branch
   ```

3. **For hotfixes (critical production issues):**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
   # Fix the critical issue
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: critical issue description"
   git push origin hotfix/critical-fix
   # Open PR to main branch (will be merged back to development)
   ```

**Important:** Always create PRs to the `development` branch for regular contributions. Only hotfixes should target `main`.

### Version 2.x (C, legacy)

- The legacy C codebase (V2, inherited from SBaGen) is available in the `v2` branch.
- No new features will be accepted for V2. Only maintenance or forks should use this branch.

## Contributing Sequence Files (`.spsq`)

If you‚Äôd like to contribute new or improved sequence files (`.spsq`), please see [`contrib/README.md`](./contrib/README.md).  
This process is separate from code contributions.

---

## Commit Convention

We use the **Conventional Commits** format.  
Examples:

- `feat: add new waveform option`
- `fix: correct parsing bug for noise sequences`
- `docs: update README with usage examples`
- `build: add Makefile for macOS`
- `chore: clean up unused code in parser`

Following this format keeps the commit history clear and enables automated changelog generation in the future.

---

## Running Tests

SynapSeq includes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Running All Tests

```bash
make test
```

This command runs all unit and integration tests in the project using Go's testing framework.

### Writing Tests

When contributing code, please:

- Add unit tests for new functions and features
- Update existing tests if you modify behavior
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR
- Follow Go testing conventions (files ending in `_test.go`)
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate for better coverage

Example test locations:

- `internal/audio/*_test.go` - Audio processing tests
- `internal/parser/*_test.go` - Parser and syntax tests
- `internal/sequence/*_test.go` - Sequence loading tests

## Pull Request Guidelines

‚úÖ Before opening a PR, please make sure:

- [ ] Your PR targets the correct branch (`development` for Go V3, `v2` for legacy C code).
- [ ] You wrote clear, descriptive commit messages (see above).
- [ ] All tests pass successfully (`make test`).
- [ ] You added tests for new features or bug fixes.
- [ ] Your changes are limited to the scope of the PR (no unrelated edits).
- [ ] Code follows Go best practices and conventions (for V3 contributions).
- [ ] Documentation is updated if your changes affect user-facing features.
